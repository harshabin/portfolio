    - Includes a slide-in "hamburger" menu for mobile navigation.
    - Swaps complex desktop animations for clean, performant mobile layouts.
- **"Solar System" Project Showcase:** A unique, interactive way to display projects using pure CSS for orbits and animations. Planets pause on hover to reveal project info.
- **Flip-Card Education Timeline:** Education history is displayed on interactive 3D flip cards on desktop and clean, simple cards on mobile.
- **Functional Contact Form:** A live contact form integrated with Formspree that sends submissions directly to my email.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js:** Make sure you have a modern version of Node.js installed (v18.x or v20.x recommended). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) to manage versions.
-   **Git:** You will need Git installed to clone the repository.

### Local Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/punithbr27/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    This project uses Formspree for the contact form. You'll need your own Formspree endpoint. Create a file named `.env` in the `client` directory if you wish to manage any frontend environment variables.

### Running the Application

You will need to run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently in separate terminals.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    -   Open a terminal in the `/server` directory.
    -   Run the command:
        ```bash
        node index.js
        ```
    -   The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    -   Open a *second* terminal in the `/client` directory.
    -   Run the command:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    -   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application live.
